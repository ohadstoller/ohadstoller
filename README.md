## Ohad Mark Stoller | <strong>Software Engineer</strong>
As a Senior Software Engineer at LayerX, I leverage my extensive experience and passion for technology to tackle challenging engineering and security problems. I contribute to all components of our platform, including backend services, browser extensions, and the LayerX dashboard and application. My work involves utilizing cutting-edge technologies and methodologies such as Infrastructure as Code (IaC), GitOps, and DevOps, to deliver robust and scalable infrastructure and product features from design to production.

With over four years of experience in software development, I have honed my skills in building cloud-native services, developing scalable microservices, and working with high-traffic environments. My expertise spans a diverse tech stack including Node.js, TypeScript, AWS, GCP, Kubernetes, Kafka, Redis, PostgreSQL, SQS, Terraform, and more. I thrive in dynamic, high-impact environments where collaboration, continuous improvement, and engineering excellence are prioritized.

I am driven by a desire to learn and excel in new domains and technologies, always striving to deliver high-quality, data-driven solutions. As a team player who values collective accountability and enjoys working in an open, empowering environment, I am dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what is possible in software engineering.
